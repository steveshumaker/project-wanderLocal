## NOTES


## TODO


- move populate experiences dispatch to the onclick of a succesful login
- refactor GET route for favorites query into one route that conditionally queries
- - the way I see it, favorites can either be a new route/saga/store combo, or add a table to experiences and update queries to POST favorite and GET favorites
- basic styling [ok]
- filter-able 'view' page
- I think making 'info' into a non-protected route that lists a collage of experiences by location could be cool [priority]
- remove unneeded components


1. business name -> business details [no - generic search w correct params]
2. business details.id -> id search - might not need this [we dont]
3. extract stars and review count [done]
4. develop some sort of ranking [or just display stars? - done]
